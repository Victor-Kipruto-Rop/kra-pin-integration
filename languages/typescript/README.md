# TypeScript / Node.js service

Requires Node.js 20+. Run `npm install`, `npm test`, then `npm start`. Strict TypeScript compiles to dist/ and uses native fetch at runtime. Configure environment variables from `.env.example`. Demo PIN A000000000B and ID 00000000. Independent server-side KRA integration; do not embed secrets in browser code. Confirm upstream response mappings in sandbox.

## Full KRA catalog (22 services)

This template exposes POST /v1/kra/{service-id} for every service in the shared catalog. See the root README and contracts/kra-services.json for the complete ID list. Send X-API-Key and JSON { "consent": true, "payload": { ... } }. Mutating services require an Idempotency-Key header (16–128 characters).

Configure KRA_SERVICE_PATHS_JSON and optionally KRA_SERVICE_METHODS_JSON from the current approved KRA API specifications. The adapter intentionally returns HTTP 501 for missing mappings instead of inventing upstream URLs or payloads. Mock mode also returns 501 for these real operations; it does not fake successful filings, TCC applications or PRNs.

For eTIMS OSCU automated testing, set KRA_ETIMS_BASE_URL to the exact HTTPS KRA host assigned in the official OSCU documentation/approval. The eTIMS service is not assumed to share the GavaConnect API host. Service-specific request/response schemas and live sandbox verification remain release gates.
